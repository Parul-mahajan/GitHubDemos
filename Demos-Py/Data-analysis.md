# Data Analysis and Visualization Project

Welcome to the Data Analysis and Visualization Project challenge! In this challenge, participants will work on a data analysis and visualization project using Python, SQL, and JSON notebooks. The project aims to demonstrate proficiency in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization techniques while leveraging GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat for assistance.

## Project Description

Participants will analyze a dataset containing information about customer transactions and demographics. The goal is to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences and create visualizations to communicate these insights effectively.

### Dataset Description

The dataset (`customer_data.json`) contains the following fields:

- `customer_id`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `age`: Age of the customer.
- `gender`: Gender of the customer (e.g., Male, Female).
- `income`: Annual income of the customer.
- `transaction_amount`: Amount of each transaction made by the customer.
- `transaction_date`: Date of each transaction.

## Tasks

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Load the dataset from the JSON file (`customer_data.json`) into a pandas DataFrame.(You can use GitHub Copilot for data generation only)
   - Explore the structure and contents of the dataset.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing values, duplicate records, and outliers.
   - Standardize data formats and resolve inconsistencies.

3. **Data Analysis:**
   - Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of key variables.
   - Calculate summary statistics and identify patterns in the data.

4. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create new features or transformations based on domain knowledge and insights from the data.

5. **SQL Queries:**
   - Write SQL queries to extract additional information from the dataset stored in a SQLite database.
   - Join multiple tables if necessary to enrich the analysis.

6. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Conduct hypothesis testing or correlation analysis to investigate relationships between variables.

7. **Data Visualization:**
   - Generate visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, bar charts) to illustrate key findings.
   - Use libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for visualization.

8. **Documentation and Presentation:**
   - Document the analysis process, including data cleaning, transformation, and analysis steps.
   - Create a presentation summarizing the insights gained from the analysis and the visualizations created.

## Guidelines

- Participants can use GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat to assist in generating SQL queries, Python code snippets, and data visualization techniques.
- Emphasize the importance of data understanding, cleaning, and visualization in deriving actionable insights.
- Encourage participants to explore advanced analytical techniques and creative visualization methods.

## Conclusion

The Data Analysis and Visualization Project challenge provides participants with an opportunity to apply their skills in Python, SQL, and JSON notebooks to real-world data analysis tasks. By leveraging GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat, participants can streamline their workflow and gain insights more efficiently, ultimately improving their proficiency in data analysis and visualization.
