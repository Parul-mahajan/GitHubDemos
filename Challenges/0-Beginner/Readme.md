# Beginner Hackathon Challenge: "Introduction to GitHub Copilot"

Welcome to the Beginner Hackathon Challenge focused on "Introduction to GitHub Copilot"! This challenge is designed for participants who are new to GitHub Copilot and aims to provide a hands-on learning experience in using Copilot to generate code snippets.

## Challenge Description

Participants will develop a simple application for basic arithmetic operations. The application should allow users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers.

## Tasks

1. **Project Setup:**
   - Initialize a new project for the arithmetic operations application.
   - Create the necessary directories and files for the project.

   **Hints:**
   - Use your preferred programming language and development environment.
   - Ensure you have a clear structure for your project, including separate files for code implementation, tests, and documentation.

2. **Prompted Code Generation:**
   - Use GitHub Copilot to generate code snippets for arithmetic operations.
   - Prompt Copilot with simple instructions for each operation (e.g., "Generate code for addition of two numbers").

   **Hints:**
   - Open the Copilot chat within your IDE or text editor.
   - Clearly describe the task and provide context about your project.
   - Specify any requirements or constraints for the code snippets you need.

3. **Implement Code:**
   - Develop the functionality of the arithmetic operations based on the generated code snippets.
   - Ensure that the implemented functions perform the specified arithmetic operations accurately.

   **Hints:**
   - Review the code snippets provided by Copilot and integrate them into your project.
   - Make any necessary modifications to fit your project's requirements and coding style.

4. **Execution and Testing:**
   - Execute the application to verify the correctness of the implemented functionality.
   - Manually test each arithmetic operation to ensure it produces the expected results.

   **Hints:**
   - Run your application and interact with it to test different arithmetic operations.
   - Verify that the results match the expected outputs for various input values.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Document the project setup, generated code snippets, code implementation, and testing process.
   - Include instructions for running the application and understanding the codebase.

   **Hints:**
   - Write clear and concise documentation covering all aspects of your project.
   - Include step-by-step instructions for setting up and running your application.
   - Provide explanations for any design decisions or implementation details.

## Guidelines

- Participants should use GitHub Copilot to generate code snippets for arithmetic operations.
- Experiment with different prompts to generate code for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Focus on understanding and implementing the generated code snippets accurately.
- Encourage participants to explore and experiment with GitHub Copilot's capabilities.

## Conclusion

The "Introduction to GitHub Copilot" hackathon challenge offers beginners an opportunity to familiarize themselves with Copilot's code generation capabilities. By completing this challenge, participants will gain valuable experience in using Copilot to generate code snippets and understand its potential applications in software development.

Let the challenge begin, and may you embark on your journey to exploring GitHub Copilot!
