# Beginner Hackathon Challenge: "Introduction to GitHub Copilot"

Welcome to the Beginner Hackathon Challenge focused on "Introduction to GitHub Copilot"! This challenge is designed for participants who are new to GitHub Copilot and aims to provide a hands-on learning experience in using Copilot to generate code snippets.

## Challenge Description

Participants will develop a simple Python application for basic arithmetic operations. The application should allow users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers.

## Tasks

1. **Project Setup:**
   - Initialize a new Python project for the arithmetic operations application.
   - Create the necessary directories and files for the project.

2. **Prompted Code Generation:**
   - Use GitHub Copilot to generate code snippets for arithmetic operations.
   - Prompt Copilot with simple instructions for each operation (e.g., "Generate code for addition of two numbers").

3. **Implement Code:**
   - Develop the functionality of the arithmetic operations based on the generated code snippets.
   - Ensure that the implemented functions perform the specified arithmetic operations accurately.

4. **Execution and Testing:**
   - Execute the application to verify the correctness of the implemented functionality.
   - Manually test each arithmetic operation to ensure it produces the expected results.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Document the project setup, generated code snippets, code implementation, and testing process.
   - Include instructions for running the application and understanding the codebase.

## Guidelines

- Participants should use GitHub Copilot to generate code snippets for arithmetic operations.
- Experiment with different prompts to generate code for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Focus on understanding and implementing the generated code snippets accurately.
- Encourage participants to explore and experiment with GitHub Copilot's capabilities.

## Conclusion

The "Introduction to GitHub Copilot" hackathon challenge offers beginners an opportunity to familiarize themselves with Copilot's code generation capabilities. By completing this challenge, participants will gain valuable experience in using Copilot to generate code snippets and understand its potential applications in software development.

Let the challenge begin, and may you embark on your journey to exploring GitHub Copilot!
